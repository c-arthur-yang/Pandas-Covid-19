Since the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic, it has wreaked havoc on the global economy and our daily life. The WHO and local government update new cases and death cases everyday, we can visualize the data while waiting for the vaccine, please check covid-19-visualization.ipynb

In LSTM.py, I use a simple model to predict the tendency of the pandemic based on LSTM, please visit https://tensorflow.google.cn/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/LSTM for details. The model is quite optimistic, I will introduce 'SIR' model to make a more robust prediction in the coming days.

The dataset is downloaded from kaggle compitition of covid-19, please visit https://www.kaggle.com/c/covid19-global-forecasting-week-5/data.
